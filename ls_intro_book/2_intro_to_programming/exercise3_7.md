What happens when you run the following code? Why?

```python
NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)
```

The program first greets Victor 3 times. It then greets Nina 3 times.

but NAME is a non-idiomatic if we use it in a reassignment
