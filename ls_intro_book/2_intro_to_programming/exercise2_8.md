To what value does the following expression evaluate?

Copy Code
'12' < '9'

Solution
The expression evaluates as True since the operands are strings, not numbers. Python performs a character-by-character comparison from left to right when comparing string values. Thus, on the first comparison, it determines that '1' < '9', so '12' must be less than '9'.
